# Mikrotata

_ὕπαγε, περιέρχου καὶ οὕτως διακίνει ἀπὸ τῶν μεγίστων ἐπὶ τὰ μικρότατα._
*Epictetus, Discourses 3.22*

Mikrotata is a minimal Bootstrap Jekyll theme designed by Patrick R. Callahan. It is designed to provide Classicists and Digital Humanists an alternative to Minima with some of the basic tools required to transcribe and present texts in Classical (and other) languages. It began as a stripped down version of the Jekyll Bootstrap installation outlined by Nick Riebeek [here](https://experimentingwithcode.com/) with the addition of a few essentials tools for the Digital Classicist.

## Installation

There are two ways to install the theme:

1. Gem-based installation. (**to come**)
2. Fork/Clone the Repository.

 - Click "FORK" on this repository.
 - Rename it `yourusername.github.io`
 - Edit the `_config.yml` file (instructions embedded for ease of use in file)

## Bootstrap Support of Aligning Text and Translation

Mikrotata is built with Bootstrap and its [grid system](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/layout/grid/) at the core of the the CSS in order to 1) to better respond to device size and 2) allow for the aligning of texts and translation. **future documentation will provide a guide for aligning**

## Language Support

_for details see language support post_

Mikrotata comes bundled with a few basic supports that should make life easier for the average Classicist looking to branch into digital work:

1. [Alpheios](https://alpheios.net/). All you need to do is set a new ClientID in the `alpheios.js` file in your `js` folder.
2. [Stikhoi](https://codepen.io/denmch/pen/ExVqKEo). A set of CSS rules with a little Javascript package to make the display of poetry a little more elegant than what is typically seen online first designed by Den McHenry with a few cosmetic changes by Patrick R. Callahan.

## Code Sharing Support

_for details see sample post_

Mikrotata also comes bundled with a couple simple Javascript packages that enable you to embed code in a post in a way that makes for one-click copying when you want to share code or wrap a body of poetry or prose in a box that allows for plain-text copying.
