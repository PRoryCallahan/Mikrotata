# Mikrotata

_ὕπαγε, περιέρχου καὶ οὕτως διακίνει ἀπὸ τῶν μεγίστων ἐπὶ τὰ μικρότατα._
*Epictetus, Discourses 3.22*

Mikrotata is a minimal Jekyll + Bootstrap theme designed by Patrick Callahan.

## Installation

Mikrotata is still in development. But you are welcome at this time to fork and suggest improvements.

## Layouts

- `default.html` : the base layout used for home page or pages you mark `layout: default` in the front matter.
- `post.html` : the layout for your posts
- `portfolio.html` : the layout for pages where you will be presenting editions of texts in any matter, to which Alpheios and language styling has been added

## Language Support

_more notes to follow_

### Alpheios

Mikrotata comes preloaded with Alpheios. All you need to do is go to go to `_includes/portfolio.html` and in the script change the clientId to refer to your own page: `clientId: username.github.io`. For how to designate language use with Alpheios in your project, see our [sample post]('/posts/2020-05-28-language-support.md').

### Latin

### Greek

In addition to Alpheios, Mikrotata comes pre-loaded with New Athena Unicode, the standard font distributed by the Society for [Classical Studies]('evelopers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started#specifying_font_families_and_styles_in_a_stylesheet_url') under an Open Font License. If an element is given the attribution `lang="grc"`, it will display in NAU. If you wish to change the default Greek font, revise `csss/custom/includes/_language.scss`.

## Addenda

### STIKHOI styling for poetry

Mikrotata uses a version of [STIKHOI by Den McHenry](https://codepen.io/denmch/details/acEIA/) with some minor adjustments to margins, etc. You can designate an element containing poetry to be styled with a `class="verse" start="x"` attribution where *x* = *starting verse number of selection*.
